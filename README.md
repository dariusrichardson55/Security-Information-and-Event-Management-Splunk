<b><h1>Splunk Project</h1></b>

As a cybersecurity analyst, It is important to have good a understanding and practical experience in Security Information and Event Management so I took the opportunity to
demonstrate this by doing a Slunk project that provides a walk-through on how to use Splunk with various features that would be commonly used in the tech companies. The
project will consist of tasks each showing how to use the features that Splunk provides. 

This project will consist of the following tasks:

<ol>
  <li>Scheduling Reports & Alerts</li>
</ol>

<h1>Website</h1>

This is the website that will be used for the project.

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/en-GB/account/login?return_to=%2Fen-GB%2Faccount%2F">Splunk Enterprise/Labs</li> 
</ul>

This is the CSV file that will be used to add the data to Splunk Enterprise. 

<ul>
  <li>sample_visualization_logs.csv</li>
</ul>
